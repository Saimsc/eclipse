When Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveils a 30-ft bronze statue of Alluri Sitarama Raju in Bhimavaram (Andhra Pradesh) on Monday, it, perhaps, will be the first such gesture by the Union Government in honouring the awe-inspiring freedom fighter that made the British spend sleepless nights a century ago.

Modiâ€™s visit is part of the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, celebrations to mark 75 years of Indian Independence. The initiative is aimed at throwing light on the lesser-known contributions that helped the country wrest freedom.</p>
<p>
The occasion marks the 125 th birth anniversary of Alluri Sitarama Raju and the centenary of the Rampa Rebellion, which he led. Though a hero and a household name in the two Telugu States, and a folk hero, he is not known much elsewhere.

Born on July 4, 1897, into a middle-class family, Alluri, as a boy, was deeply disturbed when he heard about the untold miseries that the countrymen were suffering under British rule.

Known for the brief but emphatic Rampa Rebellion in the Eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh against the British, Alluri, who is also referred to as Manyam Veerudu (Jungle Warrior), rallied thousands of poor Adviasis and kindled the spirit of freedom among them.
