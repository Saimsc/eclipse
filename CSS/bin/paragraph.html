<h1>Story 1</h1>
<p>The aspect ratio of an image or video is the proportional relationship of the width to the height. You’ll recognize it as two numbers separated by a colon in an x:y format. For instance, a 6×4 inch image has an aspect ratio of 3:2, whereas a 1920×1080 pixel video has an aspect ratio of 16:9.An aspect ratio does not have units attached—instead, it represents how large the width is in comparison to the height. This means that an image measured in centimeters will have the same aspect ratio even if it was measured in inches. The relationship between its width and height determines the ratio and shape, but not the image’s actual size.

<p>Aspect ratios are a critical part of web content because images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses, like desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media. When you use the right aspect ratios, it ensures your images or videos are displayed as intended without stretching or loss of resolution. Having an incorrect aspect ratio for your project can affect the end-user experience.</p>

<p>The background in the 5:4 ratio takes up more space around the subject, placing the subject towards the bottom-left corner.</p>
<p>It is crucial to keep the overall composition in mind when selecting an aspect ratio for your image.<p>Similar to image aspect ratios, the video aspect ratio has a profound effect on its composition. The standard 16:9, which is horizontally oriented, displays differently than the more recent vertically-oriented 9:16 aspect ratio. Always keep the context and composition in mind when choosing an aspect ratio for your project.
The 16:9 ratio is mostly seen on presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreen TVs. This international standard recently replaced the 4:3 ratio for monitors and TV screens, creating a slimmer, more elongated rectangular shape compared to the 4:3 format. Common resolutions in the 16:9 ratio are 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.</p>
